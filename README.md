# OSCar

OSCar is a tool to create GUI that sends OSC messages to control interactive software (Resolume arena, Touch Designer, Ableton, Processing, PD, UNITY, Unreal, etc)
This way you can create beautiful, responsive and touchable interfaces.

## App Setup

Created with node.js/express

I also added [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to develop with greater ease locally.

If you want to use this implementation for your own purposes try the following steps:

  1. Clone or download this repository
  2. Go into the folder you just clone/download
  2. run `npm install`
  3. run `nodemon server.js`
  4. Open a browser on `http://localhost:8080/`
