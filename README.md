[Web Version](https://trafalmejo.github.io/OSCar/)

OSCAR is a tool to create beautiful graphic user interaces (GUIs) to send OSC messages and control interactive installations (Resolume arena, Touch Designer, Ableton, Processing, PD, UNITY, Unreal, etc).
Let's create beautiful, responsive and touchable interfaces.

We are still under construction and this is a quick video DEMO of what the tool is currently able to do, but is up to you to support with feedback, documentation, suggestions, bugs detection to create a better tool.
